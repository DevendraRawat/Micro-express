# Generator

Code generator using [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/).

This generator is made to generate Express.js microservices based on specification files defined in the [specification project](../specification).

# Install

* Run `yarn install`

* Run `yarn link`

# Generate/Update a service

* `yo micro-express create <service-name>`

* Once the service is generated, implement the "TODOs" by following the information about [editing a service](../services).


=========== WIP! DO NOT USE! =============
* `yo micro-express update <service-name>` and you can use the `--force` flag to skip the prompt overwrite confirmations.

# Auth

Generated Express.js microservice using our [generator](../../generator).

To run this service use the [launcher script](../launcher.sh) as described in the [readme](../README.md).

# Description

Authentication service

# Install

* Run `yarn install`
* Install prisma CLI: https://v1.prisma.io/docs/1.34/prisma-cli-and-configuration/using-the-prisma-cli-alx4/
* Run `prisma generate`

These steps are necessary to have autocompletion.
Now you can start coding but make sure to not edit code that will be overriden by the generator. In case you want to do any change in the service contracts, you need to do it through the [specification](../specification).

# Documentation

A generated swagger documentation can be found at the route `/documentation` through the api-gateway.

You can also find the postman collection file under [services/documentation/postman/auth-postman.json](../documentation/postman/auth-postman.json).
